	  creating a new thread for every job may creates performance or memory problem.to overcome this we should 
	  go for thread pool.thread pool is a pool of already created thread ready to do our jobs.java 1.5 version 
	  introduces threadpool framework to implement thread pools.thread pool framework also known as executer
	  framework.we can create a thread pool as follows.
	  ExecuterService service = Executers.newFixedThreadPool(3);
	  
	  we can submit runnable job by using submit method
	  service.submit(job);
	  we can shutdown executer service by using shutdown method
	  service.shutdown();
	  
	  it automatically choose thread from thread pool then assigned to particular job.if threre are 2 thread at 
	  thread pool and there are 6 job to complete.then at a time only two thread can be run concurrently.after
	  completion if any thread on thread pool next job should be executed manually.
