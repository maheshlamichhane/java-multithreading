	 	The problems with traditional synchronizer keyword:-> 
	 	i. we are not having any flexibility to try for the lock without waiting.
	 	ii. there is no way to specify maximum waiting time for a thread to get lock so that thread will wait a until
	 	getting the lock which may creates performance problems which may cause deadlock.
	 	iii.if a thread releases a lock then which waiting thread will get that lock we are not having any control on
	 	this.
	 	iv. there is no api to listout all waiting threads for a lock
	 	v. the synchronizer keyword compulsary we have to use either at method level or within the method level and 
	 	it is not possible use across multiple methods.
	 	
	 	
	 	To overcome these problems sun people introducer java.util.concurrent.locks package in 1.5 version.it also
	 	provides several enhancements to the programmer to provide more control on concurency.
	 	
	 	Lock interface:Lock object is simillar to implict lock acquired by a thread to execute synchronizer method 
	 	or synchronizer block.lock implementations provide more extensive operations than traditional implict locks.
