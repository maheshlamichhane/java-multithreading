		 	ThreadLocal class provides thread local variables.thread local class maintains values per thread basis.
		 	each thread local object maintains a separate value like user_id,transaction_id etc.for each thread
		 	that accesses that object.thread can access it's local value,can manipulate it's value and even can remove
		 	it's value.in every part of the code which is executed by thread we can access it's local variable.
		 	Example: consider a servlet which invokes some business methods.we have a requirement to generate a 
		 	unique transaction_id for each and every request.and we have to pass this transaction id to the business
		 	methods.for this requirement we can use thread local to maintain a separate transaction id for every 
		 	request that is for every thread.
		 	
		 	Note:- ThreadLocal comes in 1.2 version and enhaced in 1.5 version.ThreadLocal can be associated with
		 	thread scope.
