	 	based on functionality we can group threads into a single unit which is 
	 	nothing but thread group that is thread group contains group of threads.
	 	in addition to threads thread group can also contain sub thread groups.
	 	
	 	the main advantage of maintaining threads in the form of thread group is
	 	we can perform common operations very easily.
	 	
	 	every thread in java belongs to some group. main thread belongs to main group.
	 	every thread group in java is the child group of system group either directly or 
	 	indirectly.hence system group access root for thread group in java.
	 	system group contains several system level threads like finalizer,reference
	 	handler,signal dispatcher,attaached listener.
	 	
	 	thread group is a java class present in java.lang package and it is a direct 
	 	child class of object.
	 	ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("my group");
