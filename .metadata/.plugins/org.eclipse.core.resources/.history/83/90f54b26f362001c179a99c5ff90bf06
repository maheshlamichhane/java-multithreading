	 	two threads can communicate with each other by using wait,notify,notifyall method.
	 	the thread which is expecting updation is responsible to called wait method then
	 	immediately the thread will inter into waiting state.
	 	
	 	the thread which is responsible to perform updation,after performing updation it
	 	is responsible to call notify method.then waiting will get that notification and
	 	continue it's execution with those updated items.
	 	
	 	wait,notify,notifyall methods present in object class but not in thread class
	 	because thred can call these methods on any java object. 
	 	
	 	to call,notify or notifyall methods on any object,thread should be owner of that
	 	object that is the thread should has lock of that object.that is the thread should
	 	be inside synchronized area.hence we can wait,notify or notifyall methods only
	 	from synchronized area otherwise we will get runtime exception saying IllegalMoni
	 	torStateExeception.
