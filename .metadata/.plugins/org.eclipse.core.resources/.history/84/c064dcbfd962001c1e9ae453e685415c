	      if very few line of the code required synchronization then it is not recomended
	      to declare entire method as synchronizer. we have to enclose those few line
	      of the code by using synchronizer block.
	      the main advanteage of synchronizer block over synchronizer mehtod is it reduces
	      waiting time of thread and improve preformance of the system.
	      Real world example: the highway operating only one vechile and multiple with
	      bride on the center only.
