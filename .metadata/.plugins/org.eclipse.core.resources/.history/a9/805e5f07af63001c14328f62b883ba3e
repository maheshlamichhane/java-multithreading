	 	The threads which are executing in the background are called daemon threads.
	 	example:garbage collector,signal dispature,attached listener etc.
	 	the main objective of daemon threads is to provide support for no daemon threads
	 	(main thread).for example if main threads runs with low memory then JVM runs
	 	garbage collector to destroy useless objects so that number of bytes of free 
	 	memory will be improved.with this free memory main thread can continue it's 
	 	execution.
	 	
	 	Usually daemon threads having low priority but based on our requirement daemon
	 	threads can run with high priority also.during our main thread execution if low
	 	memory found then JVM automatically turn garbage collector priority 1-10 so it
	 	runs and freed memory then main thread can continue it's execution.
	 	
	 	Checking given thread is daemon or not:->
	 	i. public boolean isDaemon();
	 	ii. public void setDaemon(boolean b);
